Pokemon Showdown bot

Description: 

Pokemonshowdown.com is a platform that hosts a game simulator for online players to battle against each other using a team of 6 Pokemon. Each Pokemon have unique combination of attacking/non-attacking moves, held item, ability, typing and stats, which makes the game so versatile and thus rendering strategizing difficult. The game requires a lot of strategizing and also a bit of luck. We want to build a bot that can challenge a random player, or receive challenge request from another player, and can actually strategize as well as making appropriate moves by itself.

How to use:

To use the bot, you would need to install nodejs. In the command prompt, run "node server.js" to start the bot up. The UI can be accessed at "http://localhost:8080"
