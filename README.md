# CynthiAI
Pokemon Showdown bot

### What is this

Pokemonshowdown.com is a platform that hosts a game simulator for online players to battle against each other using a team of 6 Pokemon. Each Pokemon have unique combination of attacking/non-attacking moves, held item, ability, typing and stats, which makes the game so versatile and thus rendering strategizing difficult. The game requires a lot of strategizing and also a bit of luck. We want to build a bot that can challenge a random player, or receive challenge request from another player, and can actually strategize as well as making appropriate moves by itself.

### How to use:

To start the bot, you would need to install nodejs latest version, or any version from 6.0 onward. In the command prompt, run "node server.js" to start the bot up. The UI can be accessed at "http://localhost:8080". Enter the information required to have the bot play games for you or to challenge it.
